# 📑 Multi-Modal RAG System for Research Papers

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to process **research papers** with support for **text, images, tables, and charts**. This project enables **deep contextual query answering** by combining advanced document parsing, multi-modal embeddings, and LLM integration.

## ✨ Features

* **Multi-Modal Support**: Handles text, figures, tables, and charts.
* **Semantic Chunking**: Splits research papers into meaningful sections for accurate retrieval.
* **Vector Search with FAISS**: Efficient similarity search across multi-modal embeddings.
* **Multi-Modal Embeddings**:

  * **Sentence Transformers** → for textual context.
  * **CLIP** → for images & charts.
* **LLM Integration**: Contextual responses powered by **GEMINI API**.
* **FastAPI Deployment**: Exposed as a REST API for scalable access.
* **Async Processing**: Optimized with Uvicorn for fast query response.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn
* **Vector DB**: FAISS
* **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers, CLIP
* **Document Processing**: PyMuPDF
* **LLM**: GEMINI API
* **Utilities**: Requests, NumPy, Pandas

## ⚡ Workflow

1. **Upload a research paper (PDF)** → parsed with PyMuPDF.
2. **Chunking & Embeddings** → text, images, tables processed into vector embeddings.
3. **Store in FAISS** → for efficient similarity search.
4. **Query Handling** → user query matched with relevant chunks.
5. **Contextual Answer Generation** → GEMINI API provides deep, context-rich response.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 📌 Example Use Case

🔍 Query a research paper:

> *"Explain the findings in Figure 3 and how they relate to the conclusion."*

✅ System retrieves **Figure 3 (chart)** + related text and produces a context-aware summary with references.

---

## 📄 Future Enhancements

* Support for **cross-modal querying** (search with images/tables).
* Integration with **Weaviate/Pinecone** for distributed storage.
* Web dashboard (Streamlit/React) for uploading and querying papers.
